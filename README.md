###Portfolio in Angular way

Composed of into and main pages

Main page has a menu-bar for default(into), resume, and contact information using ng-dialog

##stretch goal:

1) still have the gallery option: haven't decided if I wanna create gallery or slide show yet

2) maybe add hamburger menu-bar

##how to use:

from the terminal) $npm run watch
browser) localhost:8080
